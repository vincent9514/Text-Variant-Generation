# Paraphraser 

This project providers users the ability to do paraphrase generation for sentences through a clean and simple API.  A demo can be seen here: [pair-a-phrase](http://pair-a-phrase.it)

The paraphraser was developed under the [Insight Data Science Artificial Intelligence](http://insightdata.ai/) program.

## Model

The underlying model is a bidirectional LSTM encoder and LSTM decoder with attention trained using Tensorflow.  Downloadable link here: [paraphrase model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18uOQsosF4uVGvUgp6pB4BKrQZ1FktlmM)

### Prerequisiteis

* python 3.5
* Tensorflow 1.4.1
* spacy

### Inference Execution

Download the model checkpoint from the link above and run:

```
python inference.py --checkpoint=<checkpoint_path/model-171856>
```

### Datasets

The dataset used to train this model is an aggregation of many different public datasets.  To name a few:
* para-nmt-5m
* Quora question pair
* SNLI
* Semeval
* And more!

I have not included the aggregated dataset as part of this repo.  If you're curious and would like to know more, contact me.  Pretrained embeddings come from [John Wieting](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jwieting)'s [para-nmt-50m](https://github.com/jwieting/para-nmt-50m) project.

### Training

Training was done for 2 epochs on a Nvidia GTX 1080 and evaluted on the BLEU score. The Tensorboard training curves can be seen below.  The grey curve is train and the orange curve is dev.

## TODOs

* pip installable package
* Explore deeper number of layers
* Recurrent layer dropout
* Greater dataset augmentation 
* Try residual layer
* Model compression
* Byte pair encoding for out of set vocabulary
